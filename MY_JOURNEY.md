Thinking out loud
"Nfts for birth certificates of animals or people… could work. Also what if you like created nets for apartments on a tower and ownership would be linked to possession of an nft."

## Creating ERC721 NFT
worked with erc 721 nft built from scratch for better understanding ... instead of using open zepppelin.

project was created with forge and all the methods written.

### compiled with
```bash
forge create --broadcast --private-key --URI src/Nft.sol
```

created a metadata json file to add to the ipfs file

# ERC721 NFT collections (valentines day)
created a collection of nfts for valentines day. 

```bash
forge init
```
usind ipfs to store the metadata of the nfts
string metadata in ipfs folder
and auto incrementing the token id
