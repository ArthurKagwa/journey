Nft erc 721 
Ipfs(json like with details about an nft)……

## sites to check out
pinata
Open sea
snowtrace


Thinking out loud
"Nfts for birth certificates of animals or people… could work. Also what if you like created nets for apartments on a tower and ownership would be linked to possession of an nft."

## Creating ERC721 NFT
worked with erc 721 nft built from scratch for better understanding ... instead of using open zepppelin.

project was created with forge and all the methods written.

### compiled with
```bash
forge create --broadcast --private-key --URI src/Nft.sol
```

created a metadata json file to add to the ipfs file
